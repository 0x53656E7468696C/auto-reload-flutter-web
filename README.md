# auto-reload-flutter-web
Shell script to make your flutter to do reload on file changes while running on web server with custom port.

auto hotreload and auto reload won't work if you run your app through terminal, Some times I run flutter in web server mode on android and noticed that reload wont happens unless I manually press reload key on terminal 

This script fixes that.

### type chmod +x .ahr.sh.
###  Now ./.ahr.sh
